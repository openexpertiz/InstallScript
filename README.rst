Clouder - Hosting your Apps with Docker and Odoo
------------------------------------------------

`Clouder`_ is a platform which aims to standardize best practices for hosting open-source software. Whether you are launching a hosting offer, are the sysadmin of a company, or just want to host software for you and your friends, Clouder will allow you to easily deploy and maintain a professionnal infrastructure with very basic technical knowledge.

More specifically, Clouder is an orchestrator which is based on the Docker container technology. Each application will be installed inside a container and Clouder will establish links between them. 

Clouder is based on Odoo, an open-source software application which is very efficient at managing this kind of workflow and process.

Odoo - From ERP to CRM, eCommerce to CMS
----------------------------------------

`Odoo`_ is an all-in-one business management suite of mobile-friendly web apps that integrates everything you need to grow your business: CRM, website content management, project management, human resources, accounting, invoicing and more. Odoo apps integrate seamlessly to provide a full-featured open source ERP, but can also be used stand-alone.

odoo_clouder_install
====================
Automated install scripts for Odoo + Clouder:
- Odoo v8/v9 installed from upstream GIT source (`GitHub/Odoo`_)
- Clouder v8.1 installed from upstream GIT source (`GitHub/Clouder`_)
- Includes all base modules from base install of Odoo and Clouder
/!\\ BETA version, do NOT use in production! 

This scripts just needs to be preconfigured before being launched, no interaction needed. 

The script is based on the install scripts from Andr√© Schenkels (https://github.com/aschenkels-ictstudio/openerp-install-scripts), Yenthe (https://github.com/Yenthe666/InstallScript), Gustavo Valverde (https://github.com/gustavovalverde/odoo-install-scripts) with some additions from Nils Hamerlinck (http://nils.hamerlinck.fr/blog/2015/04/09/install-odoo-vps-ubuntu/)

It also follows the approach recommended in Odoo's documentation (https://www.odoo.com/documentation/9.0/setup/install.html) using pip instead of apt-get for python dependencies

 It's recommended to install this script with **elevated privileges**, so there's no need to use **sudo** to execute this procedure.
